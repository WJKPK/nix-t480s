# NixOs Configuration
***Nix***Os Configur***ation*** repository contains a personal Nix configuration of Embedded Developer & Science Enthusiast. It supports two devices:

- `Perun`  PC with Ryzen 5950x and two Nvidia GPUs for development/machine learning/simulations/virtualization and occasional gaming.
- `Abel` Thinkpad T480s intended to be handy and somewhat battery-efficient.
